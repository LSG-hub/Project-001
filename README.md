## üéØ The Problem This Solves

Traditional portfolios and resumes are static, one-way presentations. They can't answer follow-up questions, provide specific details on demand, or adapt to what a visitor is most interested in learning about. This creates friction in the hiring process and limits meaningful connections between developers and potential opportunities.

**Project 001 transforms this by creating a conversational interface where visitors can:**
- Ask specific questions about my background and get detailed answers
- Request demonstrations of particular projects or skills
- Have natural follow-up conversations 
- Get personalized explanations based on their interests
- Experience cutting-edge AI technology firsthand

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

Our system uses a robust 4-layer architecture ensuring security, scalability, and separation of concerns. The Frontend Layer handles user interaction, the API Gateway acts as a secure single point of entry, the Core Services contain the AI and business logic, and the Data Layer provides persistent storage with advanced vector search capabilities.

> **Security Note**: Only the Gateway communicates with external services. Frontend never touches the database directly - all operations go through authenticated API endpoints with Row-Level Security.

### Layer-by-Layer Explanation

**üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Layer**: Provides multiple interaction modalities - voice activation ("Hey Sreenivas"), push-to-talk, and traditional text chat. Built with Next.js for optimal performance and mobile responsiveness.

**üö™ API Gateway**: Acts as the single choke point for all requests, implementing JWT authentication, cost monitoring, rate limiting, and request routing. Only this layer has access to external AI services.

**üß† Core Services**: Contains the intelligence layer with RAG for knowledge retrieval, memory engine for conversation continuity, and MCP orchestrator for tool selection and chaining.

**üõ†Ô∏è MCP Tools**: Specialized microservices for different types of queries - profile information, project details, knowledge base search, interactive demos, and database queries.

**üìä Data Layer**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for both structured data and vector embeddings, enabling semantic search alongside traditional relational queries.

## üß† How It Works

### The Core Innovation: Memory-Enabled Conversations

Unlike simple chatbots that treat each message independently, this AI assistant maintains sophisticated memory across conversations:

**During a conversation:**
- Remembers everything discussed in the current session
- Builds context from earlier messages to provide more relevant responses
- Can refer back to topics mentioned minutes or hours ago

**Between conversations:**
- Recognizes returning visitors and greets them personally
- Recalls previous topics of interest and conversation history
- Builds a long-term understanding of each user's preferences
- Creates continuity across multiple visits to the portfolio

## üîÑ Data Flow

### User Interaction Sequence

This sequence shows how user messages flow through the system, demonstrating the sophisticated memory and tool orchestration capabilities.

```mermaid

    Orchestrator-->>Gateway: Response + metadata + cost info
    Gateway->>Database: Log cost_event + tool_invocation
    Gateway-->>Frontend: Streaming response with citations
    Frontend-->>User: Voice + Text output with clickable sources
```

### Memory Management Pipeline

This shows how conversations are progressively refined into intelligent, long-term memory - a key innovation of the system.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Raw Conversation Turns] -->|Every 10 Turns| B["Short-term Summary (session_summaries)"]
    A -->|Continuous| C["Discrete Memory Items (user_memory_items)"]
    B -->|Session End| D["Long-term User Profile (user_profiles.long_term_summary)"]
    C -->|Session End| D
    D -->|Next Session| E["Personalized Greeting & Context Loading"]
```

Key innovation: `user_memory_items` stores specific, long-term facts about each user (like their interests or past conversation topics), while `cost_events` provides granular tracking of API usage and operational costs for sustainable operation.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

Our database schema supports advanced conversational AI with persistent memory, cost tracking, and secure multi-user access. The design demonstrates production-grade data architecture with proper relationships, indexing, and security policies.

```mermaid

### Key Design Principles

**Data Separation**: Structured conversation data in relational tables, semantic content in vector embeddings for optimal query performance.

**Scalable Memory**: Progressive summarization prevents context windows from growing unbounded while maintaining conversation continuity.

**Cost Transparency**: Granular tracking of every API call with provider-specific pricing for accurate cost analysis and budget management.

**Privacy-First**: Row-Level Security ensures users can only access their own data, with easy export/deletion capabilities for GDPR compliance.

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Tools

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) orchestrator intelligently selects and chains tools based on user queries. Each tool is a focused microservice that handles specific aspects of the conversation.

```mermaid

    Engine --> ProjectsTool
    Engine --> KnowledgeTool
    Engine --> UserMemoryTool
    Engine --> ConversationTool
    Engine --> DemoTool
    Engine --> QueryTool
```

### Tool Categories Explained

**üìö Core Knowledge Tools**: Handle factual queries about background, education, skills, and project details. Use RAG system for accurate, cited responses.

**üß† Memory Tools**: Manage conversation state, user context, and personalization. Enable the system to "remember" users and build ongoing relationships.

**üéØ Interactive Tools**: Provide dynamic demonstrations, live code examples, and safe database queries. Transform static information into engaging experiences.

### Tool Selection Logic

The orchestrator uses semantic analysis to determine which tools to invoke:
- **Profile questions** ‚Üí `profile_tool` + `user_memory_tool` for personalization
- **Project inquiries** ‚Üí `projects_tool` + `demo_tool` for interactive demonstrations  
- **Technical questions** ‚Üí `knowledge_tool` + `query_tool` for detailed explanations
- **Follow-up questions** ‚Üí `conversation_tool` for context + relevant domain tools

## üîå API Structure

The API architecture demonstrates production-grade design with proper separation of concerns, security layers, and scalable endpoints.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Public["üåê Public Endpoints"]
        Auth["POST /auth/login, POST /auth/register, POST /auth/refresh, POST /auth/logout"]
        Chat["POST /chat, WebSocket /ws"]
    end
    
    subgraph User["üë§ User Endpoints (Bearer Token)"]
        UserAPI["GET /api/me/profile, GET /api/me/sessions, GET /api/me/export, DELETE /api/me/forget"]
    end
    
    subgraph Admin["üëë Admin Endpoints (Admin Token)"]
        AdminAPI["GET /admin/analytics, GET /admin/costs, GET /admin/users, POST /admin/api-keys"]
    end
    
    subgraph Internal["üîí MCP Internal (Service Token)"]
        MCPEndpoints["POST /mcp/profile/*, POST /mcp/projects/*, POST /mcp/memory/*, POST /mcp/conversation/*, POST /mcp/demo/*, POST /mcp/query/*"]
    end
    
    Gateway[API Gateway] --> Auth
    Gateway --> Chat
    Gateway --> UserAPI
    Gateway --> AdminAPI
    Gateway --> MCPEndpoints
```

### Endpoint Categories

**üåê Public**: No authentication required, handles user registration and the main chat interface.

**üë§ User**: JWT-protected endpoints for personal data management, conversation history, and privacy controls (export/forget).

**üëë Admin**: Role-based access for system monitoring, cost analysis, and user management.

**üîí Internal**: Service-token protected MCP tool endpoints, isolated from public access for security.

## üîê Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Supabase
    participant Gateway
    participant Database
    
    User->>Frontend: Visit portfolio
    Frontend->>Frontend: Check local storage for token
    
    alt No existing token (Local Mode)
        Frontend->>Frontend: Generate anonymous JWT (local mode)
        Note over Frontend: AUTH_MODE=local for development
    else No existing token (Supabase Mode)
        Frontend->>Supabase: Create anonymous session
        Supabase-->>Frontend: Anonymous JWT
    else Existing valid token
        Frontend->>Gateway: Validate token
        Gateway->>Supabase: Verify JWT (if AUTH_MODE=supabase)
        Supabase-->>Gateway: Token valid + user info
    end
    
    Gateway->>Database: Create/update user record (never from Frontend)
    Database-->>Gateway: User context loaded
    
    User->>Frontend: "Hey Sreenivas" (voice activation)
    Frontend->>Gateway: Chat request + Bearer token + request_id
    Gateway->>Gateway: Validate JWT + rate limits + load context
    Gateway->>Database: Load user context via RLS
    Gateway-->>Frontend: Personalized response with citations
```

### Authentication Modes

**Production Mode (Supabase)**: Uses Supabase Auth for production-grade user management with social logins, password reset, and email verification.

**Development Mode (Local)**: Self-signed JWT tokens for local development without external dependencies.

**Anonymous Users**: Temporary sessions for visitors who don't want to register, with limited retention and features.

## üíæ Memory Management

### Progressive Summarization Strategy

The system implements a sophisticated memory hierarchy to maintain conversation context while managing costs and token limits:

**Immediate Memory (Current Session)**:
- Stores every turn of the current conversation
- Provides full context for follow-up questions
- Resets when user leaves the page

**Short-term Memory (10-turn Summaries)**:
- Every 10 conversation exchanges generate a concise summary
- Preserves key topics and user preferences
- Maintains context without exponential token growth

**Long-term Memory (User Profile)**:
- Aggregates session summaries into persistent user understanding
- Tracks interests, preferences, and conversation patterns
- Enables personalized greetings and recommendations

**Factual Memory (Extracted Items)**:
- Stores specific facts learned about users
- Confidence scoring for reliability
- Source tracking for verification

### Context Assembly Process

For each response, the system assembles context from:
1. **Recent turns** (last 5-10 messages for immediate context)
2. **Latest session summary** (condensed medium-term context)  
3. **User profile** (long-term personalization)
4. **Relevant RAG chunks** (factual knowledge with citations)
5. **User memory items** (specific learned facts about the user)

## üé≠ User Experience Examples

### Scenario 1: Technical Recruiter
**First Visit:**
- **Recruiter:** "Tell me about your technical skills"
- **AI:** "I specialize in AI/ML with experience in Python, FastAPI, React, and cloud deployment. My recent work includes this conversational AI system, SmartRFP for document automation, and several full-stack applications. Would you like me to show you specific projects that demonstrate these skills?"

**Follow-up:**
- **Recruiter:** "Show me something with machine learning"
- **AI:** "I'd recommend the SmartRFP project where I built an AI system for automated proposal analysis. Let me open a live demo and show you the ML pipeline..." *[opens interactive modal with live demo]*

**Return Visit (Next Week):**
- **Recruiter:** "Hi, I'm back"
- **AI:** "Welcome back! Last time you were interested in my ML work, particularly the SmartRFP project. I've actually made some updates to the system since we last talked. Would you like to see what's new, or shall we explore other aspects of my background?"

### Scenario 2: Potential Collaborator  
**First Visit:**
- **Developer:** "What kind of projects are you working on?"
- **AI:** "I'm currently focused on AI-powered applications that solve real business problems. My latest work includes this conversational AI portfolio system, SmartRFP for intelligent document processing, and some experimental work with voice interfaces. I'm particularly interested in projects that push the boundaries of human-AI interaction."

**Same Session - Follow-up:**
- **Developer:** "The voice interface sounds interesting, how does that work?"
- **AI:** "Great question! This very conversation can actually work through voice - you can say 'Hey Sreenivas' to activate it. The system uses Web Speech API for recognition, processes requests through our AI pipeline, and responds with synthesized speech. The interesting challenge was maintaining conversation context across voice interactions..."

**Return Visit:**
- **Developer:** "Hi again"
- **AI:** "Hey there! Good to see you back. Last time we discussed my current projects, especially the voice interface work. You seemed particularly interested in the technical implementation. Have you had a chance to try the voice features, or would you like to dive deeper into any specific aspects?"

### Scenario 3: Casual Visitor
**Voice Interaction:**
- **Visitor:** "Hey Sreenivas" *(spoken)*
- **AI:** *(spoken response)* "Hi there! I'm Sreenivas's AI assistant. You can ask me anything about his background, projects, or skills. I can show you live demos, explain technical concepts, or just have a casual conversation about his work. What interests you most?"

**Mixed Interaction:**
- **Visitor:** *(types)* "What's the most interesting project?"
- **AI:** "That's a great question! I'd say this very portfolio system is pretty unique - having a conversation with an AI version of a person instead of reading a static resume. But if you're looking for business impact, the SmartRFP system is fascinating - it can analyze complex proposal documents and extract key information automatically. Want me to show you either one in action?"

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Innovation Showcase

This project demonstrates several advanced AI/ML concepts through practical implementation:

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**What it is:** A technique that combines the flexibility of large language models with the accuracy of database searches.

**Implementation here:** When you ask about projects, the system searches through the knowledge base using semantic similarity, finds the most relevant information, and uses that context to generate comprehensive, accurate responses.

**Innovation demonstrated:** Prevents AI hallucination while maintaining natural conversation flow. All responses include source citations for verification.

### 2. Vector Embeddings & Semantic Search
**What it is:** Converting text into mathematical representations that capture meaning, allowing computers to understand semantic similarity.

**Implementation here:** Questions like "What did you study?" and "Tell me about your education" both find the same relevant information, despite using different words.

**Innovation demonstrated:** True semantic understanding beyond keyword matching, enabling intuitive natural language queries.

### 3. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
**What it is:** Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources.

**Implementation here:** The AI dynamically calls different tools - profile information, project demos, database queries - all through a standardized, secure protocol.

**Innovation demonstrated:** Modular, extensible AI architecture that can grow while maintaining security and reliability.

### 4. Progressive Memory Summarization
**What it is:** A technique for maintaining long conversation context while staying within AI model limitations.

**Implementation here:** Every 10 message exchanges get summarized into key points, allowing the system to remember important details from much longer conversations.

**Innovation demonstrated:** Persistent memory across sessions without exponential cost growth or context limit issues.

### 5. Row-Level Security & Privacy
**What it is:** Database-level security ensuring users can only access their own data.

**Implementation here:** Even with database access, users can only see their own conversation history, never other users' data.

**Innovation demonstrated:** Production-grade security architecture suitable for real-world deployment.

### 6. Cost-Aware Architecture
**What it is:** System design that tracks and optimizes AI API usage in real-time.

**Implementation here:** Every request is monitored for token usage and cost, with automatic budget enforcement and usage analytics.

**Innovation demonstrated:** Sustainable AI application design with economic constraints built into the architecture.
